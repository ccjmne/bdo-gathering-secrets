Pigs ===========================================================================

    In Solgaji Forest, on the route West towards Shimnidae Forest, just before
    crossing the river, to your right.


Birds ==========================================================================

    KkoKko ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    East of Bukpo, about 275 metres directly South of Gyeongjae, by the pier
    that offers a ferry to the Martial God Tournament (where Uturi dwell).

    You can just ride straight there, despite the route being quite steep.

    The birds are pretty hard to spot—they're small, flightless birds—but you
    won't miss the red dots on your minimap.  I'm unsure whether they respawn
    fast enough, though.


Tier 6–7 Horses ================================================================

    At the top of Mount Ahshi, the highest point in Land of the Morning Light.
    There's some Platinum in the centre of the lake there, as well.

    TODO: Confirm there are indeed some Tier 7...
