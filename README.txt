Foxes ==========================================================================

                                    TOO FEW

    Around the area between Gowun Plateau and Dokkebi Forest, right atop
    (altitude-wise) Duoksini's lair, just a smidge down and right from its icon
    on the World map.  They're right by the road going down southwards from the
    Gowun Plateau.


Boars ==========================================================================

    In Solgaji Forest, on the route West towards Shimnidae Forest, just before
    crossing the river, to your right.

    There are some more in Yeowoo Pass, near Gumiho's Shrine, just 80 metres
    down and South from Hosan, the stable keeper from the Honglim Base.


Birds ==========================================================================

    KkoKko ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    East of Bukpo, about 275 metres directly South of Gyeongjae, by the pier
    that offers a ferry to the Martial God Tournament (where Uturi dwell).

    You can just ride straight there, despite the route being quite steep.

    The birds are pretty hard to spot—they're small, flightless birds—but you
    won't miss the red dots on your minimap.  I'm unsure whether they respawn
    fast enough, though.


Tier 6–7 Horses ================================================================

    At the top of Mount Ahshi, the highest point in Land of the Morning Light.
    There's some Platinum in the centre of the lake there, as well.

    TODO: Confirm there are indeed some Tier 7...
